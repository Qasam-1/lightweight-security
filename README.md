## üöÄ Projects

### 1. Password Strength Checker (`password_checker.py`)
Checks if a password is strong or weak using simple rules (length, uppercase, numbers, symbols).  
‚û°Ô∏è Modify it to enforce company policies or ban common passwords.

### 2. Port Scanner (`port_scanner.py`)
Scans the first 1024 ports of a target machine.  
‚û°Ô∏è Added threading for faster scanning (mini-Nmap style).

### 3. Caesar Cipher (`caesar_cipher.py`)
Implements one of the oldest encryption methods.  
‚û°Ô∏è Good practice for text processing and cryptography basics.

### 4. Keylogger (`keylogger.py`)
Logs keystrokes to a file (`keylog.txt`).  
‚ö†Ô∏è For **educational use only**, run on your own machine.  
‚û°Ô∏è Can be expanded with timestamps or sending logs securely.
